### Behind the principles 

+ There's nothing groundbreaking about them, just common sense. Sadly though, I see common sense disappear amongst people.
+ The principles are targetted at young people, 30 and lower.
+ Use of simple language for accessibility. 
+ These principles, especially the first one, have had an incredible impact on me as a person. Love is the engine for everything I do, and if that was the case for more people, the world would be a better place.




# 1. All work should benefit people around you.
Develop yourself for the sake of making the lives of people close to you better.
Love and social relationships are the most important things in life. 
> # Make love the engine for everything you do.

### 2. The world needs more beauty and nature.
The places we live in should be designed beautiful. The places we spend time in have a huge impact on our mental health. A combination of traditional architecture, lots of green spaces, and walkability.

# 3. People should be people, not machines or monkeys.

What is freedom?
+ Many people nowadays are slaves to algorithms (machine) and vices (monkey).

A society cannot be free without laws. Just like drugs are illegal for a reason, many just as harmful vices are legal. Humans are drawn to vices.
>  If access to vices is limited, they die out. It takes time, but it will happen. 


> What is a vice?
+ A vice/sin is anything that makes you feel an illusion of satisfaction. It's an illusion because in reality it will never fill the empty hole in you, but it will pretend to.
+ Vices have negative effects on us as individuals and people around us.

The vice with the worst impact on our society is porn / lust. It destroys patience, creates fake expectations of sex, looks and relationships, and most importantly, corrupts the mind. Also, many men nowadays suffer of a death grip syndrome.

> About algorithms
+ People should think for themselves, and refuse help of AI - neuralink, chatgpt, etc. This limits creativity, thinking, and promotes laziness and dependency. Don't let your mind detoriate, be free.


# 4. Detachment from world events.
News or social media should not sway your emotions. 
+ That's exactly what they're set up to do, so don't let them. You should limit the time spent with them, and ideally get to a point where you completely forget they exist.

# 5. Live local.
You should only concern yourself with your partner, friends, and family. Live a simple, slow life.
> Being a positive, loving influence will be the best decision you can make.





# What are the  principles based on?

> Effects of technology:

Technology should serve people and make our lives easier. In addition to benefits it brings humanity (healthcare, automation, convenience), it has very drastic impacts on society. 

> Suggested solutions:

+ Get off all social media, without any exception, period. 
+ Turn off all notifications on your phone except for calls and messages from your partner and family. Become less accessible.
+ On Android, block all harmful websites you frequent with https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teqtic.lockmeout&hl=de&gl=US&pli=1 
+ On PC, use the hosts file. Pasting these lists will make access to bad influence harder.  https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts

Optional: Uncluster the web: Addons Ublock origin, Sponsorblock, I don't care about cookies
